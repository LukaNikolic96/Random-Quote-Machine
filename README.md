**Inspirational Quotes React App**

Project Overview:
Welcome to the GitHub repository of my Inspirational Quotes React App! This engaging web application aims to inspire users with a collection of thought-provoking quotes. As the creator and developer of this app, I leveraged React to build a dynamic and interactive experience, providing users with new quotes and the ability to share them on Twitter.

Technologies and Libraries Used:

React: The core of this application, React, enables the creation of reusable components, efficient rendering, and a smooth user experience.

API Integration: The app fetches a vast collection of quotes from the "https://type.fit/api/quotes" API, offering a diverse range of inspirational content.

JavaScript (ES6+): The app's functionality heavily relies on modern JavaScript, including async/await, arrow functions, and array methods, to fetch and manipulate the quote data.

HTML/CSS: HTML structures the components, while CSS styles the app's layout and elements, providing a visually pleasing interface.

Bootstrap: The Bootstrap framework enhances the app's responsiveness, ensuring seamless display across various screen sizes.

Randomization: JavaScript's randomization techniques empower the app to present users with a random quote from the collection and change the background color upon each new quote.

Twitter Sharing: The app includes a feature to share a favorite quote on Twitter, using a URL generated with encoded quote text and the Twitter intent API.

Key Features and Functionality:

Fetching Inspirational Quotes: Upon the app's initial load, the API is queried to obtain a diverse range of inspirational quotes, which are then stored in the app's state.

Random Quote Display: Users are welcomed with a randomly selected quote and its author's name (if available). The app dynamically updates this quote with each click of the "New Quote" button.

Background Color Change: Each time a new quote is displayed, the background color of the app changes, providing an engaging and refreshing experience.

Twitter Sharing: Users have the option to share their favorite quotes on Twitter, clicking the "Twitter" icon, which opens a tweet window with the quote text and author's name pre-filled.
